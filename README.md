# pbasw_flutter_exam
Small app made as a 1 week project to complete my course in Dart/Flutter taken when i studied for PBA in Software Development.

<br>

## Features:
- Page 1
  - Retrieve 50 random users from [randomuser.org](https://randomuser.org)
  - User card with different info
  - Pull down to refresh
- Page 2
  - See user cards created by users stored in Firebase' Firestore
  - Add, edit or delete these users
    - Add by pressing on FAB
    - Edit by pressing on user card
    - Delete by holding down on user card

<br>

## Goal:
Combine all the different things we learned from the course into one small app, which is why the app makes no sense at all.
